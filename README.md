Welcome to my Connect Four project for The Odin Project.

The aim of this project is to build out a connect four game which plays on
the command line, by using the Test Driven Development(TDD) coding approach.

I'll write a test(s) for code I want to write, run the test (to fail),
then write the appropriate code, and test again (to pass).
